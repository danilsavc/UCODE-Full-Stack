<h2 id="whatmakes">What makes a superhero?</h2>

<p>
    A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a 
    superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b> and you need to use 
    that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
    For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a 
    good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal 
    human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br><br>

    Black Widow<br><br>
    Black Widow, was one of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. 
    As a child, she was indoctrinated into the Red Room by General Dreykov, 
    and briefly lived as the surrogate daughter of Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff while they were undercover in the United States of America. 
    After the Destruction of the North Institute, she underwent extensive psychological conditioning, before graduating from the Red Room as a Widow.
