                <p>Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                    Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America 
                    Comics #1 (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America 
                    was designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely 
                    Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following 
                    the war, and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. 
                    Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.</p>

                <p>Thor is the blood-son of Odin, All-Father of the Asgardians,
                     and Jord, who was also known as Gaea, the earth-goddess who 
                     was one of the Elder Gods.[2] Odin claimed that he sought to 
                     father a son whose power would derive from both Asgard and Midgard 
                     (as the Earth realm is called by Asgardians), and hence he sought 
                     to mate with Jord. Odin created a cave in Norway where Jord gave 
                     birth to Thor.[50] Months after the infant Thor was weaned, Odin 
                     brought him to Asgard to be raised. Odin's wife, the goddess Frigga, 
                     acted as Thor's mother from that time onward, and for many years Thor 
                     believed her to be his birth-mother. Not until many centuries later did 
                     Thor learn the purported truth that Jord was his birth mother,[51], though 
                     the Phoenix has asserted that Odin had lied about Thor's parentage and that 
                     it was his birth mother through Firehair, an ancient human mutant and avatar 
                     of the Phoenix Force,[32] claiming that Gaea was a lie to ensure that Thor would 
                     dedicate himself to protecting the Earth.[2]</p>
